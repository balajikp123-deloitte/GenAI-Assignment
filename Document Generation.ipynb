Simplified Payment VerificationIt is possible to verify payments without running a full network node.  A user only needs to keep a copy of the block headers of the longest proof-of-work chain, which he can get by querying network  nodes  until  he's  convinced  he  has  the  longest  chain,  and  obtain  the  Merkle  branch linking  the  transaction  to  the  block  it's  timestamped  in.   He  can't  check  the  transaction  for himself, but by linking it to a place in the chain, he can see that a network node has accepted it, and blocks added after it further confirm the network has accepted it.As such, the verification is reliable as long as honest nodes control the network, but is more vulnerable  if  the  network  is  overpowered  by  an  attacker.   While  network  nodes  can  verify transactions  for  themselves,  the  simplified  method  can  be  fooled  by an  attacker's  fabricated transactions for as long as the attacker can continue to overpower the network.  One strategy to protect against this would be to accept alerts from network nodes when they detect an invalid block,  prompting  the  user's  software  to  download  the  full  block  and  alerted  transactions  to confirm the inconsistency.  Businesses that receive frequent payments will probably still want to run their own nodes for more independent security and quicker verification.9. Combining and Splitting ValueAlthough it  would be possible to handle coins individually, it  would be unwieldy to make a separate  transaction  for  every cent  in  a  transfer.   To  allow value  to  be  split  and  combined, transactions contain multiple inputs and outputs.  Normally there will be either a single input from a larger previous transaction or multiple inputs combining smaller amounts, and at most two outputs: one for the payment, and one returning the change, if any, back to the sender.  It should be noted that fan-out, where a transaction depends on several transactions, and those transactions depend on many more, is not a problem here.  There is never the need to extract a complete standalone copy of a transaction's history.5TransactionIn.In Out.Hash01Hash2 Hash3Hash23Block HeaderMerkle RootPrev Hash NonceBlock HeaderMerkle RootPrev Hash NonceBlock HeaderMerkle RootPrev Hash NonceMerkle Branch for Tx3Longest Proof-of-Work ChainTx310. PrivacyThe traditional banking model achieves a level of privacy by limiting access to information to the parties involved and the trusted third party.

The public can see that someone is sending an amount to someone else, but without information linking the transaction to anyone.
