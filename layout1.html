                <ul>
                    <li>It is possible to verify payments without running a full network node.</li>
                    <li>A user only needs to keep a copy of the block headers of the longest proof-of-work chain, which can be obtained by querying network nodes.</li>
                    <li>Generate a Merkle branch linking the transaction to the block it's timestamped in.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2 style="color: blue">Combining and Splitting Value</h2> 
                <ul>
                    <li>Transactions contain multiple inputs and outputs.</li>
                    <li>Accepting payments by combining smaller amount of inputs.</li>
                    <li>Returning change by outputting it back to the sender.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2 style="color: yellow">Privacy</h2> 
                <ul>
                    <li>Keeping public keys anonymous to maintain privacy.</li>
                    <li>Using a new key pair for each transaction to keep them from being linked to a common owner.</li>
                    <li>Understanding the risk of revealing other transactions if the owner of a key is revealed.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2 style="color: red">Alerts from Network Nodes</h2> 
                <ul>
                    <li>The network node can detect an invalid block.</li>
                    <li>Prompt the user's software to download the full block and alerted transactions.</li>
                    <li>Businesses that receive frequent payments will probably still want to run their own nodes.</li>
